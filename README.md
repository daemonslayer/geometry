# Geometry

## Projective Geometry
- Used widely in Computer Graphics to project higher dimensional geometry to 2D 
- Amazing Book : Perspectives on Projective Geometry by Jürgen Richter-Gebert
## Discrete Differential Geometry
- Used to perform operations on geometry
- Amazing Resource : (https://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2021/)
## Information Geometry
- Used to understand algebraic spaces in a geometrical context. Possible uses in understanding the hypothesis space of Learning Algorithms
