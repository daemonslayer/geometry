# Geometry

## Projective Geometry
- Used widely in Computer Graphics to project higher dimensional geometry to 2D 
- Amazing Book : Perspectives on Projective Geometry by Jürgen Richter-Gebert
## Discrete Differential Geometry
- Used to perform operations on geometry
- Amazing Resource : (https://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2021/)

### Introduction
- Language for talking about local properties of a shape and their connection to global properties
- Local Properties
  - how fast are we travelling across a curve
  - how much does the surface bend at a point
- Global Properties
  - 
- **Difference with Differential Geometry** : Infinity is not allowed in the discrete setting. Infinitely high values or infinitesimals (limits) are not allowed. Hence, Differentiation and Integration have to be redefined in terms of allowed parameters of lengths, angles and other physical measures.
- **Game for conversion from continuous to discrete setting**: 
  1. Find out **equivalent** definitions for continuous concepts in discrete setting
  2. Apply smooth definition to object in 

## Information Geometry
- Used to understand algebraic spaces in a geometrical context. Possible uses in understanding the hypothesis space of Learning Algorithms
